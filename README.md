# User Manual
This is a guide on how to use our recently updated source code. So far we have created an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in python, where it is starts by user drawing the graph first.

# Step-by-step usage

1. run the DAA.py file
2. Input the first node label
3. input second nodel label
4. input the the weight from first node to second node
5. choose whether to add more nodes or not.
   - if yes (input: y)
     1. Input the first node label
     1. input second nodel label
     3. input the the weight from first node to second node
   - if no, we can continue.
6. Chose starting node
7. chose destination node
8. should return the shortest path from chosen starting node to destination node
